_.NET | MAUI | Entity Framework | API_

## Introduction
This project is meant as a learning playground. One purpose is of course to explore .NET MAUI, but also allowing me to dig deeper into other areas. The project is in no way intended for production purposes. 

## Architecture 
Initially, it will have a backend CRUD API and a MAUI frontend Android application.
//TODO - add a image

## Design
Starting of, the design will be simple. The intent of this project is not to build a great looking application. It will start by simply being able to show and manage the entities persisted in the backend. The entities will be called locations, and are meant to represent a location on a map, however adding a map feature is far away and might very well not be implemented at all.

## Development path
- Develop a basic CRUD API with persistent storage.
